        <div class='foundedWords'>
            <p>We've gathered the world's experts in extraction operations and in anti-child trafficking efforts to bring an
                end to child slavery. O.U.R.'s Underground Jump Team consists of former CIA, Navy SEALs, and Special Ops
                operatives that lead coordinated identification and extraction efforts. These operations are always in conjunction
                with law enforcement throughout the world.<br>Once victims are rescued, a comprehensive process involving
                justice for the perpetrators and recovery and rehabilitation for the survivors begins.<br>It is time for
                private citizens and organizations to rise up and help. It is our duty as a free and blessed people.</p>
            <h2>Domestic Services</h2>
            <p>O.U.R. salutes our nation's law enforcement officers and prosecutors at the federal, state and local levels who
                protect our country's children. Law enforcement professionals skillfully investigate, arrest and prosecute
                those who violate children. Our nation's police efforts to protect children in the U.S. are light years ahead
                of many, if not all other countries. O.U.R. acknowledges the expertise and extraordinary work done by these
                dedicated men and women who bravely battle the scourge of child sexual exploitation. O.U.R. shares the mission
                to save children and seek justice for those who victimize them, therefore O.U.R. is committed to enhancing
                law enforcement efforts by providing resources where budget shortfalls prohibit a child pornography, child
                exploitation or human trafficking operation from going forward. O.U.R. will also provide or facilitate child
                exploitation investigative training in U.S. jurisdictions where a need exists. Collaborating with law enforcement
                will reduce duplication, promote best practices and avoid other potential issues which might arise without
                close coordination. O.U.R. is privileged and honored to support our nation's heroes in this important cause
                to deter, disrupt and dismantle child exploitation and the trafficking of children in our nation's communities.</p>
