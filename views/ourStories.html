            possible. These are stories of those who've experienced or been affected by trafficking.</p>

        <p>Operation Whale Watch was a high-risk mission that Operation Underground Railroad's ops leader felt was worth the risk. And he was right. <br><br> Twenty-four young women were rescued in this operation in Latin America. Only one was a minor. But that one minor is key in the potential punishment of the five traffickers. Because of that 16-year-old girl, they are now facing 15-30 years in prison. That's a good day's work. <br><br> The mission went pretty much as planned, but was considered high risk for several reasons. First, these traffickers were professionals. They knew what they were doing and they had been doing it for a long time. They were organized, connected, and well prepared to deal with whatever came along. "This was a sophisticated crime ring. The real deal," said the ops leader. "These guys controlled the drugs and the women, creating heightened security risks." <br><br> Second, they were armed. O.U.R.'s advance team had done their homework and knew these thugs usually packed heat. "The head guy was armed," said the ops leader. "He carried a pistol on his left hip." On the other hand, O.U.R.'s jump team members' weapons are more imperceptible, in that they are highly trained on a physical, mental, emotional and spiritual level. All these assets are top notch and have served them well. <br><br> Third, some of the local police were less than trustworthy. "He had the local police in his control, " said the ops leader. "We believe this guy had the local police on his payroll." In order to vet out such situations, O.U.R. works closely with the U.S. Embassy and the federal government of whatever country they are operating in. "They always support us from afar," said the ops leader. In this particular location, they knew some of the local police had been compromised.</p>
